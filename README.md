# Honors_Project_IEC
Homework 2 written in javascript where a user is prompted to enter an ID number and the code checks the validation of the ID following a set of rules. 

I had chosen homework 2 becuase it was my poorest scored homework and thus I wanted to put more effort into understanding what the assignment was about and what I needed to create to achieve its objectives. The assignemnt was written on JSFiddle code editor and is shared through a github repository to be ran through a console to validate the code. 

This was a learning expeirence for me as a first year honors student and I am gratful the ability to have this assignment created and graded. Thank you for your effort and time.
